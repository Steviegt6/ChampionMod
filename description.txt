[c/009933:-=-Champion Mod Info-=-]
Champion Mod is a small community made project meant to make Terraria more interesting. Currently it has a slow production but is seen as a labor of love from the small team involved in its development. It would be the team's dream to expand our horizons and recruit any new people willing to help out. The mod currently adds many different weapon types, crafting materials and miscellaneous items to spice of Terraria gameplay. There currently is a new NPC, the Farmer, and a boss in development.
