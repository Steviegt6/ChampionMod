-=-Main Mod Information-=-

Champion Mod is a small community made project meant to make Terraria more interesting. Currently it has a slow production but is seen as a labor of love from the small team involved in it's development. It would be The Team's dream to expand our horizons and recruit any new people willing to help out. This has potential to become a passion project, rather than a pastime.
